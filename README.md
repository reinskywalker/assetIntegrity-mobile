Next, you will need to wait for the gradle building.

* Open Android Studio and select `File->Open...` or from the Android Launcher select `Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)` and navigate to the root directory of your project.
* Select the directory or drill in and select the file `build.gradle` in the cloned repo.
* Click 'OK' to open the the project in Android Studio.
* A Gradle sync should start, but you can force a sync and build the 'app' module as needed.

### Gradle (command line)

* Build the APK: `./gradlew build`

## Running the Sample App

Connect an Android device to your development machine.

### Android Studio

* Select `Run -> Run 'app'` (or `Debug 'app'`) from the menu bar
